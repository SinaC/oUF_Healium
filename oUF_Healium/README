/heal doesn't work after /dps --> skin must be an external addon with a requireddep on tukui but a optionaldep on oUF_Healium

TODO:
Disable Tukui_Raid and Tukui_Raid_Healing on logon if found
DumpFrame
ElvUI skin
raid header name: check oUF_MovableFrames.lua   fct smartName
add tab in tukui skin if Tukui_TabMenu found add options in contextual menu
set button.hNotUsable, find which event could be used to check this (usable = select(1,IsUsableSpell))
resize frame (smaller height) when raid > 15
pet spells
reload settings/UpdateFrameButtons when resetting talents
why raid frame moves automatically? -> probably because unitframes are centered in raid frame
multirow: 2 rows of spell/buff/debuff (looks ugly :p)
character specific settings
